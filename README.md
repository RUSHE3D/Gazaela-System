Implementation of one or several hidden services that work through TOR routing.

The project ideas are:

v1.0: Implementation of the container with the services and configurations necessary to function

v2.0: Implementation of an administration panel for the hidden services that are working, taking advantage of the capabilities of the internal network of Docker to manage it locally

v3.0: Implementation of IDS and event control to detect threats
